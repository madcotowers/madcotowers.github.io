Godfrey 121687-Tower 1 Panel 1

In the upper left hand corner of this panel is an image of the Madison County Illinois township map. In the upper left hand corner of map, highlighted in dark green, is Godfrey. The name of the town, which was laid off by Captain Benjamin Godfrey and Enoch Long, is placed on the records as Monticello, but is universally called Godfrey. The town plat was recorded 30th May 1840.

Townships listed next to Godfrey are: Foster, Moro, Omphghent, Olive, New Douglas, Alton-Wood River, Fort Russel, Hamel, Alhambra, Leef, Chouteau, Edwardsville, Pin Oak, Marine, Saline, Venice, Granite City, Nameoki, Collinsville, Jarvis, St. Jacob, Bethalto.

Moving over to your right (upper right corner) is an image of Captain Benjamin Godfrey, for whom the township was named. Captain Godfrey was an influential early settler. Benjamin Godfrey, a sea captain, was born in Cape Code Massachusetts-4 December 1794 and he died August 13, 1862, and is buried in the Godfrey Cemetery.

He came to this area in 1832.

Dropping down to just below the image of the township map, there is an image of the Benjamin Godfrey Memorial chapel. It was built in 1854. This was a joint effort between the Monticello Seminary and the Congregational Church. In 1991, the chapel was moved from its original site on highway 67 to the Lewis & Clark College Campus.

This simple New England chapel, built in 1854, is in the Greek Revival Style.

Moving to the right of the Benjamin Godfrey Memorial Chapel, there is an image of Monticello Female Seminary, founded by Benjamin Godfrey, It opened in 1838.The larger image shows a smaller coloured photograph of what the school looks like today. The school closed in 1971 and the campus was purchased by Lewis & Clark Community College (Colored photograph courtesy of Lewis & Clark College).

Moving back to the left side, just below the Benjamin Godfrey Memorial Chapel image, is an image of Rocky Fork A.M.E. Church founded by Rev. Erasmus Green, the son of a slave woman. Rev. Green had the distinction of serving the Union during the Civil war as a member of the U.S Colored Infantry. Following his military service, Rev. Green returned to Rocky Fork to build a church and farm.

The Rocky Fork area in Godfrey was a refuge for run- away slaves. Courageous African-Americans risked their lives to escape slavery then continued to reach back to help others gain freedom. Native Americans provided protection and refuge to run-aways until the close of the war of 1812. “White Friends to Humanity”, acting in response to their antislavery beliefs, also

assisted slaves. In 1828, with the protection and assistance of Don Alonzo Spaulding and his family, Rocky Fork became a large scale under-ground railroad station. Operated by both blacks and whites, the station drew fugitive slaves from Southern Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The history of Rocky Fork presents a compelling, multi-racial effort that spanned decades.

Moving back to the right hand side, you will find some history of Charles A. Lindbergh. Below is a photo of Charles Lindbergh in his plane (Photograph by Francie Crivello.

Prior to his historic flight across the Atlantic Ocean-20-May 1927, Charles served as an Air Mail Pilot. He personally selected a 40 acre site, on Airport Road in what is now Godfrey, for use as an emergency landing field during the Chicago to St. Louis mail flights. In August 1926, the United States Government leased the tract of land from William L. Waters. The landing strip was illuminated by flood lights and marked with 1250 candle power beacon light on the top of a 60 foot steel tower.

Mail pilots used the landing strip when inclement weather, poor visibility or mechanical problems did not permit a safe flight into Lambert Field in St. Louis. Just below the photo of Charles Lindbergh in his plane, are three photos that show the small frame station that was erected at the field to store oil, fuel and spare parts for mail planes and offered simple accommodations for pilots forced to stop at the station. The photo on the right of that shows the inventory being stored and just below that photo is another showing the accommodations. These photographs courtesy- Pam Wisler.

Moving over to the left, there is a photo of a one-room school. It was built in 1847 at a cost of $98. In 1836 the school expanded to two-rooms. The Summerfield School closed in 1958 and students were transferred to Clifton Hill, McKinley and Irving Schools.
