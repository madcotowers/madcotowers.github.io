Foster Township 121687-Tower 2 Panel1-4

To the right hand side of the panel is text that reads: Foster Township is named for Oliver P. Foster, an early resident. His father, Oliver Foster, brought his family to the area in the 1820’s and built Foster Inn on Springfield Road, the regular stage coach route from Alton to Springfield. The Inn became a relay station for the stagecoach line in addition to being a popular stop for travelers and area residents.

*The plat of Foster was recorded Oct 12, 1857. It was 1st called “Foster” but when the application for a post office was made in 1858, it was found that there was another office of the same name and the “Burg” was added.

Moving over to the left hand side there is a print image of the Farm Residence of T.N. Harris. In 1852 Thomas Harris and family left Ohio and traveled to what is now Foster Township where he built a large brick home and began farming the land. Two of Harris’ sons, William and Thomas Nathan (T.N.), served with the Union Army during the Civil War. The two brothers survived the conflict and returned to Foster Township, settling on the area farms.

Interesting note: the “1894 Portrait and Biographical Record” include biographies of both brothers, and of their politics and states that William is a “Straight Forward Republican” while Thomas Nathan is a “Pronounced Democrat.”

Directly below the print image of the T.N. Harris Farm Residence, is a photo image of James and Matilda Ballinger family reunion. In 1910, the African-American family of James and Matilda Ballinger, met for a reunion at Woods Station in Foster Township, James Ballinger, a Civil War Veteran from Missouri, moved to Woods Station area after the war and purchased a farm. James and Matilda, who spent the remainder of their lives on the farm, were known by neighbors as---“good farmers and neighbors”.

To the right of the “Ballinger Reunion” photo image are two images, one imbedded in the other. The first photo image, at the top, is of Fosterburg School. Established in 1858, a brick and frame structure was built to house the School. As enrollment grew, a one-room frame school building was erected and, eventually, partitioned into two class rooms. This was completely destroyed by the tornado

of 1948; the school was rebuilt in 1949.The second photo image is from 1890 and is of the students at Fosterburg School.

Just below those two photo images and in the middle of the panel, is the photo image of the Salem Baptist Church, in 1925. It shows the Salem Baptist Church Congregation standing outside the church. The church was organized in 1845; the Rev. W.D. Anderson as the first Pastor. The first church, a frame structure, was expanded in 1878 and again in 1912. Many families of African-American descent in the area have been strongly linked to the church for many years.

Moving down to the left and just below the Salem Baptist Church image are two photo images of workers in a field. The image to the left side shows four men in a field resting. The text below the image reads: Harry Price, Bill Emery and two unknown workers rest during wheat harvesting. There also is a dog in the image.

Moving across and to the right is the other photo image of workers. The text reads “Workers taking a break from wheat threshing at the Drexelius farm.

Moving down and to the left, a heading reads, “The Tornado of 1948”.Text below that reads “ shortly after 6:00am on March 19, 1948, a tornado tore through Fosterburg before striking two towns to the northeast, Bunker Hill and Gillespie. Thirty people died and more than 200 people were injured by the deadly twister which left towns of Fosterburg and Bunker Hill in ruins.

Below this text are two photos images of the devastation. The photo image on the left hand side is that of the Glen Voumare home in Fosterburg. The text below that reads: “The Glen Voumare home in Fosterburg was one of only four homes left standing in Fosterburg. Within four hours after the tornado strike the Red Cross arrived at the scene of the destruction to provide needed assistance”.

The photo image on the right hand side shows the remains of the Zion Presbyterian Church in Fosterburg. The church and parsonage, which stood to the left and right of the bulletin board, were reduced to rubble. Only the bulletin board remained.
